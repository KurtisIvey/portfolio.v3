          Hey there! My name is Kurtis and I'm a former over the road truck
          driver/instructor turned Developer ðŸšš . My interest in coding began
          while I was driving all throughout the country delivering freight and
          needed a game plan once I decided to exit that industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I am today, and I have kept up that dream of becoming a
          developer. My main focus these days is my speciality in the use of
          React, and its use in building accessible digital experiences for a
          variety of users.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Fun Fact:</span> I've traveled a distance that is equivalent to
          circling the Earth 28 times while trucking, so I'm pretty much a
          professional at sitting on my butt.
